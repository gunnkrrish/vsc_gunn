// in between insert-delete
|| Array.splice(start_index, deleteCount, [insert_item1 , insert_item2 , ...]);              //in this start_index and deleteCount is mandatory to write
books.splice(1,3);    delete 3 elements from index 1
books.splice(1,0,"a","b","c");  start from index 1  to delete nothing 0 then values to insert
bools.splice(1,2,"book1","book2","book3"); to start from index 1 delete 2 elements and add book1,book2,bool3
arr1=[1,2,2];
arr2=[4,5,6];
arr3=arr1.concat(arr2); 
to check that it is array or not we use isArray() method
to check if element presnt or not use includes() method
reverse() method reverses the elements positions in the array so that last element goes into the first position
